Project 2 in FYS-3150

Here you can find all the programs developed in project 2. I have used classes instead of functions for the jacobi algorithm, although they do the same (in my case). I copied and used, with only small changes, the same header files for all the projects in QT creator. I realized at a later stage that it is not usual to have the class inside the header file, this is my first time writing a class. To save time I decided to not use time on implementing the classes in a cpp file and only decleare the class in the header file. 

Did also not have time to implement unit testing, but did make my own test program for the jacobi algorithm.
